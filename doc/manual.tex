\section{Introduction}
MstatX aims to provide a simple and easy-to-extend solution for multiple alignment statistics calculation. 
A multiple alignment is simply defined by an alphabet of symbols and a list of words made with this alphabet.
The definition of statistics calculation is completely independant and can be seen as a module or a plug-in.\\

The default usage of MstatX is for multiple alignment of protein sequences, so, it uses amino acids substitution 
matrix to calculate statistics. But it is possible to use it for any alphabet with any scoring scheme defined by 
the user.\\

MstatX has two side: the end-user side and the programmer side. 
If you wants to calculate statistics already available in MstatX, then read the section \ref{user_sec}. 
If you want to add a new statistics module in MstatX, then read the section \ref{prog_sec} to have some examples of
already coded statistics modules.

\section{User side} 
\label{user_sec}
This section is dedicated to the usage of MstatX. If you want to add a statistics module in MstatX, read section \ref{prog_sec}.\\

\subsection{Getting started}
The basic use of MstatX is like the following:
\begin{verbatim}
mstatx -m example.mali
\end{verbatim}
This command will calculate the trident statistics of each columns in the multiple sequences alignment given in file {\verb example.mali} .
